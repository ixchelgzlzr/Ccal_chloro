### "The chloroplast genome of Calasterella californica in relation to structural genomic evolution in liverworts
Submitted to **Molecular phylogenetics and evolution**

### Abstract

DNA sequences evolve not only through changes in individual nucleotides,
but also through the gain, loss, movement, or transformation of genes or
sets of genes. In the chloroplast genome, many of these structural changes
are diagnostic of large clades; and thus, there have been studies that have
used structural changes as characters for phylogenetic analysis of land plants.
Thanks to a recent increase in the availability of chloroplast genomes, it is
now possible to study the evolution of these structural changes in historically
understudied groups like liverworts. In this paper, we report the de novo as-
sembly of the chloroplast genome of _Calasterella californica_, and compare
it to the plastome of 38 other species of liverworts. Furthermore, we use a
combination of phylogenetic inference and stochastic mapping tools to assess 
the use of chloroplast structural changes in phylogenetic inference, and
to better understand the evolutionary patterns of these traits. Overall, the
gene content and gene arrangement is very conserved in the chloroplast of
liverworts. The phylogenetic inferences based on structural-changes-only are
able to retrieve some of the larger clades of liverworts (like Aytoniaceae, or
the complex thalloids lineage) but disagree with our current understanding
of liverwort phylogenetic relationships, which is based on inferences from
nucleotide evolution models. These disagreements appear to be driven by
the convergent loss of sets of genes potentially associated with the evolu-
tion of epiphytic and parasitic life styles (like in the case of _Aneura mirabilis_
and _Treubia lacunosa_). We found that, congruent with our expectations,
structural changes (_i.e._, gene gain/loss) evolve slower than nucleotides. Nev-
ertheless our ancestral state reconstructions suggest that structural evolution
can be complex, especially for genes that can be “multistate’—_e.g._, in the
case of pseudogenization and tRNAs—for whom evolutionary rates are com-
parable to nucleotide substitution rates. While inferences from structural
evolution alone partially conflict with inferences from nucleotide evolution,
inferences with structural and nucleotide data together produce hypotheses
with higher support. In this sense, the use of structural data might still be
relevant for inferring the relationship of some groups. Finally, we argue that
a better understanding of the processes that drive structural evolution will
help to build evolutionary models more adequate for this type of data.
